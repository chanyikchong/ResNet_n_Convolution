# ResNet_n_Convolution

In the Jupyter notebook, I define a convolution layer class which will be used in the convolution neural network. The linear layer and the batch normalization layer are also defined. In part2, I implement a ResNet and train it on the cifar10 dataset.

#Prequisites

Before running the notebook, you need to install the following package.
numpy, torch and matplotlib.
